      <h3>Why do I do it?</h3>
      <p>Creating a business in France for foreigners is hard and the fact is that you can be overwhelmed by all the requirements which most of the time are not written as processes can be quite new.</p>
      <ul class="list-unstyled">
        <li class="well">I really like to guide anyone who's willing to come no matter their background is.</li>
        <li class="well">I believe we need to learn from peers, the problem is the culture and language stops people from learning and doing it more efficiently.</li>
        <li class="well">Even though your startup idea might not be 'successful' the whole purpose is to keep trying until you make it happen and it's a fact that France is top in resources.</li>
        <li class="well">I'll try to share all the knowledge as a founder and as a parent. I've collected for the past year since I begin this expat journey.</li>
        <li class="well">I just want more people to focus on the important issues of their businesses and less on burocracy. I'll try my best to prevent you from making some of the mistakes I learned from.</li>
